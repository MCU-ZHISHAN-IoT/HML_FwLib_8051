zCLI is a lite command line interface which entirely runs on target MCU. It provides a basic frame to do command from user via 
UART and supports following functions:
+ basic input & output function

zCLI just a toy, and it written by [Weilun Fong](mailto:wlf@zhishan-iot.tk) in 2020. However, it can also help people learn how 
to achieve a own CLI program on MCU with limited on-chip zone. zCLI is now released as a example file inside HML. Welcome PR or
issues to improve this CLI program, thx!
