<h3> What is HML_FwLib_8051 </h3>
<p>
HML_FwLib_8051 is the first member component of HML firmware libraries, providing a group of functions for users to handle the on-chip resources of 8051 MCUs, including GPIO, external interrupt, timer and UART modules. The 8051 MCUs have been one of the most widely used MCUs since it was produced by Intel in 1981. As amateurs with some experience of 8051 development, we intend to develop a lite and easy-use tool that can help future developers to complete projects based on 8051 MCUs more easily and quickly.
<br>
The source codes are written in C language and for SDCC compiler, i.e., it can only be compiled by SDCC. This choice is motivated by the fact that SDCC is free and highly efficient, while there are very few examples of application about SDCC on the Internet. We hope that, as one of the early attempts to develop MCU projects using SDCC, this work will make SDCC become more popular among MCU developers.
